# My First Web Development Project

Welcome to my first web development project! As a newcomer to the world of web development, I've spent the past 5 days diving into HTML and CSS. In this short span, I've managed to create a clone landing page inspired by Apple.com. While it's not yet responsive and furnished, it marks the beginning of my journey into the vast realm of web development.

## Project Overview

This project is a clone page inspired by Apple's official website. It serves as a starting point for me to apply and practice the HTML and CSS concepts I've learned so far.

## Learning Journey

As a beginner, my code may not be perfect, and the CSS might not be as tidy as I aspire it to be. However, everyone starts somewhere, and I am dedicated to improving my skills over time. This project is a testament to my commitment to learning and growing as a web developer.

## Future Plans

I acknowledge that the current version is not responsive, but as I continue my learning journey, I plan to enhance the code and make the landing page responsive. With each new concept I grasp, I'll iteratively improve this project to reflect my evolving skills.

## Feedback

If you're an experienced developer stumbling upon this project, feel free to provide constructive feedback. I'm open to learning and eager to improve my coding practices.

## Getting Started

To view the landing page, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lelin07/apple.com-clonepage.git
cd apple.com-clonepage
```

Open `index.html` in your browser to see the landing page.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to express gratitude to the web development community for its wealth of resources that have supported my learning journey.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
